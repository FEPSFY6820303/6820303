    <h1 id="Abstract"> <b>Abstract</b></h1>
    <h2 style="fontsize: 12;">The problem of artificial space debris was first explored by Donald Kessler in 1978. In this article I will summarize some of his conclusions and provide a more up to date comparison of his predictions to subsequent events, particularly the recent fine, levied by the US government at Dish Network. I will explore how the increasing awareness of space debris, and its dangers, are similar to the increasing awareness over the last 50 years of climate change, and how parallels can be drawn between the two issues.</h2>
    <h3 id="Introduction"> <b>Introduction</b></h3>
    <h4 style="fontsize: 12;">As the number of artificial satellites orbiting the earth increases, the probability of collisions between these satellites also increases. Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each of which increasing the probability of further collisions.” (Kessler, Donald J 1978, Page 1). The ramifications of this feedback loop may result in devastating impacts, and, as the annual number of orbital launches increases (Our World in Data, n.d.), the implications of this effect become increasingly concerning.</h4>
    <h5 id="Analysis"> <b>Analysis and Discussion</b></h5>
    <h6 style="fontsize: 12;"> On the 2nd of October, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a fine for the communications company Dish Network, for failing to properly dispose of their defunct Echo star-7 satellite. (FCC News, 2023) This is a high-altitude communications satellite should have been sent into a graveyard orbit at 36000Km, 300Km higher than the crowded geostationary region of space. (ESA 2008) (ESA 2020) 
This is the first fine of its kind and demonstrates an increasing awareness - from the United States at least – that high levels of space debris may threaten the stability of vital services provided by satellite technology, such as GPS and weather reporting. This increasing awareness is reminiscent of the increasing awareness of climate change by the international community over the last half century. The first meeting of the IPCC occurred in 1988, (IPCC 1988) and since then, the recognition that climate change is an existential threat has become ubiquitous. This will likely soon be the case for space debris. 
As Kessler describes in his original 1978 paper, the results of hypervelocity (>4000-5000 ms-1) (www.esa.int, 2005) collisions result in fragmentation or vaporisation of one or both objects (Kessler, Donald J 1978). A collision between a smaller and larger object, where both objects are vapourised is known as a catastrophic collision, if only the smaller object is vapourised, and the larger only cratered and/or fragmented the collision is non-catastrophic. (nasa.gov 2023) For a non-catastrophic collision at 10Kms-1, the ejected mass will be around 115 times the mass of the smaller object. (if the larger is less than 115 times the size of the smaller, this would be a catastrophic collision). (Kessler, Donald J 1978) As such, there is a significant quantity of ejected mass, potentially resulting in a chain reaction (Kessler, Donald J 1978).
