    <b3 id="Abstract"> <b>Abstract</b></b3>
    <b5 style="fontsize: 12px;">The problem of artificial space debris was first explored by Donald Kessler in 1978. In this article I will summarize some of his conclusions and provide a more up to date comparison of his predictions to subsequent events, particularly the recent fine, levied by the US government at Dish Network. I will explore how the increasing awareness of space debris, and its dangers, are similar to the increasing awareness over the last 50 years of climate change, and how parallels can be drawn between the two issues.</b5>
    <b3 id="Introduction"> <b>Introduction</b></b3>
    <b5 style="fontsize: 12px;">“As the number of artificial satellites [...] increases, the probability of collisions between these satellites also increases. Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each increasing the probability of further collisions.” <a href="Kessler, Donald J 1978">(Kessler, Donald J 1978, Page 1)</a>. The ramifications of this feedback loop may result in devastating impacts, and, as the annual number of orbital launches increases (Our World in Data, n.d.), the implications become increasingly concerning.</b5>
    <b3 id="Analysis"> <b>Analysis and Discussion</b></b3>
    <b5 style="fontsize: 12px;">On the 2nd of October, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a fine for the communications company Dish Network, for failing to properly dispose of their defunct Echo star-7 satellite. (FCC News, 2023) This is a high-altitude communications satellite should have been sent into a graveyard orbit at 36000Km, 300Km higher than the crowded geostationary region of space. (ESA 2008) (ESA 2020)
      
This is the first fine of its kind and demonstrates an increasing awareness that high levels of space debris may threaten the stability of vital services provided by satellite technology, such as GPS and weather reporting. This increasing awareness is reminiscent of the increasing awareness of climate change by the international community over the last half century. The first meeting of the IPCC occurred in 1988, (IPCC 1988) and since then, the recognition that climate change is an existential threat has become ubiquitous. This will likely soon be the case for space debris.
      
As Kessler describes in his original 1978 paper, the results of hypervelocity (>4000-5000 ms-1) (www.esa.int, 2005) collisions result in fragmentation or vaporisation of one or both objects (Kessler, Donald J 1978). A collision between a smaller and larger object, where both objects are vapourised is known as a catastrophic collision, if only the smaller object is vapourised, and the larger only cratered and/or fragmented the collision is non-catastrophic. (nasa.gov 2023) For a non-catastrophic collision at 10Kms-1, the ejected mass will be around 115 times the mass of the smaller object. As such, there is a significant quantity of ejected mass, potentially resulting in a chain reaction (Kessler, Donald J 1978).

    <b5 style="fontsize: 12px;">Kessler references retrieval as a potential solution to this problem. He points out that since around 90% of aggregate orbiting satellites’ cross-sectional area is contained within just 20% of satellites (Figure. a), removal of these satellites from orbit would have a significant effect on reducing collision rate. However, as collision frequency increases, the proportion of cross-sectional area contained within larger satellites will decrease (large satellites will increasingly be broken up and become fragments) If we are to take advantage of retrieval, it must be as soon as possible. (Kessler, Donald J 1978).
      
The European space agency (ESA) has identified what they describe as “active debris removal” (ADR) as a strategic goal. (www.esa.int, n.d) They have also stated that newly launched objects should comply with “post mission disposal guidelines”. This means that all ADR efforts can go towards reducing orbital debris rather than compensating for debris from new launches. They state that “a business-as-usual approach will lead to progressive and uncontrolled increase [in debris] […] with collisions being the primary source” (www.esa.int, n.d)  this proves that up-to-date information and research supports the predictions of Kessler, nearly 40 years later.
      
ESA predict that, with 90% adherence to regulation, and no orbital explosions, the orbital space will still experience a steady increase in debris with an initial collision rate of around 1 every 5 – 9 years.  Accounting for increased launch rate, the orbital environment can be stabilised with the removal of 5–10 large objects per year. (www.esa.int, n.d) Active debris removal will be costly and inefficient, especially at first. Clearspace Ltd have been awarded a £2.2 million contract for preliminary research by the UK space agency, whilst only aiming initially to remove two satellites. (Clearspace 2022) This resembles technologies like carbon capture, in which the US has invested $6.6Bn (Bloomberg (2023) . Potentially vital, but wildly costly.
      
There are already examples of orbital collisions. In 2009, the Russian Kosmos 2251 satellite collided with the communications satellite iridium 33, producing around 2,000 pieces of debris bigger than 10 cm, and around 200,000 in the range 1–10 cm. Around 30% of these will still be in orbit 20 years later.  (Johnson, 2009) Others since then include the YunHai 1-02 satellite colliding with some debris. In total there have been five confirmed accidental orbital collisions, three of the satellites involved still being operational at the time. (NASA 2021) The Ecuadorian cube sat Pegasus is also suspected to have collided with debris in 2013.

    <b5>
      Kessler uses three methods to extrapolate the number of orbital debris into the future (Figure b). He bases these on different assessments of the growth rate pre-1978. Whilst these basic assessments have their clear drawbacks, they may provide an indication of how quickly debris numbers can grow. They also demonstrate the uncertainty of predictions in this field. In this way, the issue of space debris is similar to the issue of climate change. Approximate macroscopic predictions can be made, however we may not know how catastrophic the implications, until it is too late.
      
      In the last part of his paper, Kessler sets out a bleak forecast for a “potential debris environment” (Kessler, Donald J 1978) He describes an accretion disk of debris orbiting the earth, and after billions of years, a system of rings, like Saturn’s rings (Kessler, Donald J 1978), but comprised of artificial debris. This is a stark image and places the effects of neglecting the responsibility of maintaining our orbital space alongside the climatological effects of neglecting the atmospheric and terrestrial space. Short term human decisions having effects on our planet lasting thousands of generations.

      In Conclusion, managing space debris, and controlling its growth, is vital to maintain the stability of services that rely on satellites. It should be a part of every space-faring nation, and cooperation’s environmental and sustainability policy. The implications of neglecting it could be catastrophic, and as significant as the threat of climate change.
